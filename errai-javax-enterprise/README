This project provides a handful of modified javax.enterprise interfaces. These
override their official counterparts for Errai client-side code. Our versions
can be successfully compiled by the GWT compiler.


== Attention Eclipse (m2e or m2eclipse) Users ==

The build configuration that Maven Integration for Eclipse creates from this
POM yields an Eclipse project that won't compile. Here's how you fix it:

In the Package Explorer view:

 - Expand src/main/java
 - Expand javax.enterprise (within src/main/java)
 - Right click on super (within javax.enterprise)
 - From the popup menu, choose Build Path -> Use as Source Folder

The project should now compile, and dependent projects in your workspace
(errai-cdi-client for example) should now also build cleanly.
