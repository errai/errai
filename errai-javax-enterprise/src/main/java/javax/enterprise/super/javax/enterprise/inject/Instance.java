/**
 * <p>Allows the application to dynamically obtain instances of
 * beans with a specified combination of required type and
 * qualifiers.</p>
 *
 * <p>In certain situations, injection is not the most convenient
 * way to obtain a contextual reference. For example, it may not
 * be used when:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>the bean type or qualifiers vary dynamically at runtime, or</li>
 * <li>depending upon the deployment, there may be no bean which
 * satisfies the type and qualifiers, or</li>
 * <li>we would like to iterate over all beans of a certain type.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In these situations, an instance of the <tt>Instance</tt> may
 * be injected:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Inject Instance&lt;PaymentProcessor&gt; paymentProcessor;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Any combination of qualifiers may be specified at the injection
 * point:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Inject &#064;PayBy(CHEQUE) Instance&lt;PaymentProcessor&gt; chequePaymentProcessor;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Or, the {@link javax.enterprise.inject.Any &#064;Any} qualifier may
 * be used, allowing the application to specify qualifiers dynamically:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Inject &#064;Any Instance&lt;PaymentProcessor&gt; anyPaymentProcessor;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Finally, the {@link javax.enterprise.inject.New &#064;New} qualifier
 * may be used, allowing the application to obtain a
 * {@link javax.enterprise.inject.New &#064;New} qualified bean:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Inject &#064;New(ChequePaymentProcessor.class)
 * Instance&lt;PaymentProcessor&gt; chequePaymentProcessor;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For an injected <tt>Instance</tt>:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>the <em>required type</em> is the type parameter specified at the
 * injection point, and</li>
 * <li>the <em>required qualifiers</em> are the qualifiers specified at
 * the injection point.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The inherited {@link javax.inject.Provider#get()} method returns a
 * contextual references for the unique bean that matches the required
 * type and required qualifiers and is eligible for injection into the
 * class into which the parent <tt>Instance</tt> was injected, or throws
 * an {@link javax.enterprise.inject.UnsatisfiedResolutionException} or
 * {@link javax.enterprise.inject.AmbiguousResolutionException}.</p>
 *
 * <pre>PaymentProcessor pp = chequePaymentProcessor.get();</pre>
 *
 * <p>The inherited {@link java.lang.Iterable#iterator()} method returns
 * an iterator over contextual references for beans that match the required
 * type and required qualifiers and are eligible for injection into the class
 * into which the parent <tt>Instance</tt> was injected.</p>
 *
 * <pre>for (PaymentProcessor pp: anyPaymentProcessor) pp.test();</pre>
