/**
 * <p>Indicates that a bean directly specializes another bean.
 * May be applied to a bean class or producer method.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>If a bean directly specializes a second bean, it
 * inherits:</p>
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>all qualifiers of the second bean, and</li>
 * <li>the name, if any, of the second bean.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p>If the second bean has a name, the bean may not
 * declare a name using
 * {@link javax.inject.Named &#064;Named}. Furthermore,
 * the bean must have all the bean types of the second
 * bean.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a bean class of a managed bean is annotated
 * <tt>&#064;Specializes</tt>, then the bean class must
 * directly extend the bean class of a second managed bean.
 * Then the first managed bean directly specializes the
 * second managed bean.</li>
 * <p/>
 * <li>If a bean class of a session bean is annotated
 * <tt>&#064;Specializes</tt>, then the bean class must
 * directly extend the bean class of a second session bean.
 * Then the first session bean directly specializes the
 * second session bean.</li>
 * <p/>
 * <li>If a producer method is annotated
 * <tt>&#064;Specializes</tt>, then it must be non-static
 * and directly override another producer method. Then the
 * first producer method directly specializes the second
 * producer method.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p>If a bean is specialized by any enabled bean, the
 * first bean is disabled.</p>
