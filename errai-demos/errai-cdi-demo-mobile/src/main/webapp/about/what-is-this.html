<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This app demonstrates how you can use Errai to stream HTML5 device
		orientation data from browsers to the server, aggregate that data, and
		broadcast it back out to the browsers, again using CDI events.

<h1>How does it work?</h1>

<h2>Client-to-server</h2>
<p><em>Note: some of the boxes in the flowchart are hyperlinks to the associated source code.</em></p>

<ol>
		<li>The browser periodically generates deviceorientation events,
			which our detector class has registered to receive
		<li>Our DOM deviceorientation listener creates <a
			href="java-sources/org/jboss/errai/demo/mobile/client/shared/OrientationEvent.java.html">OrientationEvent</a>
			and fires it as a CDI event.
		<li>Because there is an <a
			href="java-sources/org/jboss/errai/demo/mobile/client/shared/OrientationEvent.java.html">OrientationEvent</a>
			observer method on the server, ErraiBus routes the event across the
			wire to the server
		<li>The server-side <a
			href="java-sources/org/jboss/errai/demo/mobile/server/OrientationDataSatellite.java.html">observer
				method</a> adds this new client orientation data into an <a
			href="java-sources/org/jboss/errai/demo/mobile/client/shared/AllClientOrientations.java.html">aggregated
				set of all client orientations</a>.
	</ol>

<h2>Server-to-client</h2>
<p><em>Note: some of the boxes in the flowchart are hyperlinks to the associated source code.</em></p>
<iframe src="server_to_client.svg"><a href="server_to_client.svg">Click Here for Flow Diagram</a></iframe>
	<ol>
		<li>A timer on the server periodically fires, initiating the
			process of firing the aggregated set of all known client orientations
			(<a
			href="java-sources/org/jboss/errai/demo/mobile/client/shared/AllClientOrientations.java.html">AllClientOrientations</a>)
			as a CDI event. (We also weed out clients who we haven't heard from
			in the past couple of seconds at this point).
		<li>The server-side ErraiBus routes this event to every connected
			client, because they all have CDI Observers for the
			AllClientOrientations event.
		<li>On the client, the client-side MessageBus delivers the <a
			href="java-sources/org/jboss/errai/demo/mobile/client/shared/AllClientOrientations.java.html">AllClientOrientations</a>
			event to the client-side code.
		<li>The client-side code updates the DOM with the new client
			orientations using a CSS3 perspective transform. (Each client is
			represented by a &lt;div&gt; element to which the transform is
			applied.)
	</ol>

	<h1>Why is this awesome?</h1>

<p>There are lots of reasons, really:
<ul>
		<li>HTML5 deviceorientation events are one of the newest things you
			can do with a web browser, and we've demonstrated how simple it is to
			add support for something like this to your own Errai app. The tiny
			amount of <a
			href="java-sources/org/jboss/errai/demo/mobile/client/local/Html5OrientationDetector.java.html">glue
				code</a> provides a bunch of benefits.
		<li>CDI events are a great way to build a <em>loosely
				coupled</em> system: the component that generates the OrientationEvents
			has no idea who is listening to those events (or even if those
			listeners are on the client side or the server side!) Because of
			this, it's completely reusable. In fact, we're planning to extract
			this demo's set of OrientationEvent producers into an Errai module
			that you can reuse.
		<li>Likewise, the observers of these events don't know how those
			events are produced. They just process the events when they arrive.
		<li>GWT's deferred binding mechanism gives us a simple, reusable
			way to choose the correct producer of OrientationEvents for the
			browser we're in.
	</ul>
