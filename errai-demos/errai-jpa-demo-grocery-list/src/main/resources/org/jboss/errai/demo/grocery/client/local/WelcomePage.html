                </h3>
                <p>As you move toward a more and more declarative style, you allow the compiler and the framework to catch
                    more mistakes up front. Broken links? A thing of the past!

                </h3>
                <p>The problems you're actually trying to solve are complex enough as it is. Don't make the novel code that
                    solves your specific problems into the needle in a haystack of configuration, repetitive meaningless drivel,
                    and ornate constructions that work around the framework.

                    <span>When it comes to solving a business problem in code, once is</span> <em>more than</em> <span>enough!
                        As compelling as the autonomous AJAX based client architecture is, when your client code is in
                        JavaScript and your server code isn't, you're now committed maintaining two apps in parallel, and
                        keeping them up-to-date in lock step.</span>
