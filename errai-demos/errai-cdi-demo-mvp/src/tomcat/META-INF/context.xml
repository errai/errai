<!--
     This context.xml causes Tomcat to insert Weld's CDI BeanManager into
     the JNDI context at java:/comp/env/BeanManager. This is required in
     Tomcat because Weld's normal boostrap doesn't work: the JNDI context
     is read-only to the webapp.

     To ensure this file is placed in your generated WAR, activate the
     "tomcat" profile during your build:

     % mvn clean package -Ptomcat

     For details on deploying Weld into Tomcat, see
     http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/1.0.0/en-US/html/environments.html
