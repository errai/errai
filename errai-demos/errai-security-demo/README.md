# Errai Security Demo

## Overview

This simple app demonstrates how Errai Security can be used in conjunction with Errai UI, Errai Navigation, Errai RPC, and Errai JAX-RS to declaratively secure UI elements, pages, and remote services.

### Errai UI

Errai UI allows fields in plain HTML5 and CSS templates to be bound to fields in Java classes. Errai Security enhances this by providing a declarative syntax to hide Errai UI fields from unauthorized users.

### Errai Navigation

Errai Navigation allows you to declaratively define pages within your single page app with compile-time verified links. Errai Security provides a declarative syntax for restricting an unauthorized user's access to pages.

### Errai RPC and JAX-RS Services

Errai RPC and Errai JAX-RS provide a convenient, type-safe way of accessing services from the client, either through the Errai Message Bus or from a Rest Service, respectively. Errai Security can be used to declare either kind of service interface as restricted, so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users.

## Try It Out

### Get It Running

To try it in dev mode, ensure you have Maven 3 installed, then type the following at a command prompt:

    % mvn gwt:run

To deploy a .war file to JBoss EAP 6, or AS 7, start the application server and run:

    % mvn clean package jboss-as:deploy

### Demo App Pages

#### Welcome Page
* Greets a logged in user with their name.

#### Login Page
* Allows users to log in and out.
* A user will be redirected here if they attempt to access a restricted resource while unauthenticated.

#### Messages Page
* Contains buttons which trigger remote services.
* The "Say Hello!" service uses JAX-RS and requires a user to be authenticated.
* THe "Ping for admin" service uses Errai RPC and requires a user to be authenticated as a user with the role "admin".

#### Admin Page
* This page is only accessible by users with the role admin.
* You can try to setting `#AdminPage` as the hash value in the url.

#### Security Error Page
* A user is directed here when they attempt to access a service for which they do not have authorization.

### The Navigation Bar

The navigation bar has links to the first three pages described above when not logged in. It does also have a link to the Admin Page, but this link is hidden when not logged in as a user with the role "admin".

### Try Logging In

This demo has to users:

#### John
* **username**: john
* **password**: 123
* **roles**: admin

#### Hacker
* **username**: hacker
* **password**: 123

### Keycloak Integration

This demo also features Keycloak integration. To preview this you will need a Keycloak server. You can download a fully-configured in the [Keycloak appliance zip file](http://sourceforge.net/projects/keycloak/files/1.0-beta-3/keycloak-appliance-dist-all-1.0-beta-3.zip/download). To run this server, unzip the file, `cd` into the directory, then run `keycloak/bin/standalone.sh`.

The following instructions assume you are using the Keycloak server from the link above.

1. Start the Keycloak server.

1. Go to the [Keycloak Administrative Console](http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/) (the username and password are both *admin*).

1. Select the *Applications* tab and click *Add Application* and fill in the following:

  * **Name** : errai-security-demo

  * **Access Type** : public

  * **Redirect URI** : http://localhost:8080/errai-security-demo/\*

1. After saving, click on the new application in the menu and make sure the following are set:

  * In the *Claims* tab allow *Username*, *Name*, *Email*.

  * In the *Scope* tab move the *user* and *admin* roles from *Available Roles* to *Assigned Roles*.

1. In the *Users* tab click *Add User*.

  * Fill in the *Username*, *Email*, *First Name*, and *Last Name* with any values.

  * After saving go to the *Credentials* tab and set a password.

  * Go to the *Role Mappings* tab. Add add *atleast one* role the *Assigned Roles*.

1. Uncomment the login-method tag in `errai-security-demo/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`.

1. While the Keycloak server is running, run `mvn clean package wildfly:deploy` which will build the demo and deploy it to the running Wildfly server.

1. Go to the errai-security-demo [login page](http://localhost:8080/errai-security-demo/#LoginForm). If the Keycloak setup has worked, you should see a link to log in with Keycloak beside the login button. Click this link to login as the user you created.
