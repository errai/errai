Errai To-Do List Demo
=====================

This demo app shows how to use the following technologies together:

 * ErraiCDI
 * ErraiJPA (with an early preview of data synchronization)
 * ErraiUI Templates
 * Errai Data Binding
 * Errai Page Navigation
 * Errai Bean Validation

There is a [7-minute screencast](https://vimeo.com/55454764) of an earlier version
of this demo being created.

Try It Out
==========

This demo is designed to work with a full Java EE 6 server such as JBoss EAP 6 or AS 7. Although
it should be possible to craft a deployment of this demo to a simpler web server, it's much simpler
to deploy to an EE 6 capable app server.


Prerequisites
-------------

 * Maven 3 (run `mvn --version` on the command line to check)
 * JBoss AS 7 or EAP 6 running on the local machine
   * With a data source named ErraiTodoDS

To configure the datasource in AS 7 or EAP 6, edit the file `standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
and add this immediately after the similar entry for `ExampleDS`:

    <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/ErraiTodoDS" pool-name="ExampleDS" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
      <connection-url>jdbc:h2:mem:erraiTodo;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1</connection-url>
      <driver>h2</driver>
      <security>
        <user-name>sa</user-name>
        <password>sa</password>
      </security>
    </datasource>

Of course, you are encouraged to configure the data source to connect to a more permanent database
such as PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of H2. With the above "in-memory" configuration, the data you
enter into the demo will not survive restarts of the app server.


Build and Deploy
----------------

To build a .war file and deploy it to the local running JBoss EAP 6 or AS 7 instance:

    % mvn clean package jboss-as:deploy

Once the above command has completed, you should be able to access the app at the following URL:

    http://localhost:8080/errai-jpa-demo-todo-list/


Code-and-Refresh
----------------

To try it in GWT's dev mode, after completing the above steps, do this:

    % mvn gwt:run

Then click "Launch in Default Browser" on the GWT Dev Mode window that appears.
