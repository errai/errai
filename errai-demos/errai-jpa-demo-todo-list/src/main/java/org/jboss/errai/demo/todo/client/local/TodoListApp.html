     This HTML file is an Errai UI "designer" Template. We say "designer"
     because your graphic designers (or you, with your designer hat on) can
     work with any old HTML+CSS tools you like, and get a realistic preview
     of the UI straight off the filesystem. No processing is required.
     
     The data-field attributes in this template tie its elements to fields
     in the related TodoListApp and TodoItemWidget classes. Those related
     fields are annotated with @DataField.
     
     Try opening this file in your web browser, and you'll see what we mean!
     Make some changes and hit refresh. Instant feedback. Excellent!
     
     Try editing the CSS file at css/TodoList.css and refresh your browser.
     Instant feedback there too!
     
     For the ultimate instant feedback experience, find an "instant reload"
     plugin for your browser, and you should see the preview update whenever
     you save this file or the related CSS file. If you're using Chrome, we
     recommend LivePage:

     Happy Coding!
