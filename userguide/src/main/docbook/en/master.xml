      <title>What is it</title>

      <para>Errai is a GWT-based framework for building rich web applications
      using next-generation web technologies. Built on-top of ErraiBus, the
      framework provides a unified federation and RPC infrastructure with
      true, uniform, asynchronous messaging across the client and
      server.</para>

      <title>What is Errai Bus?</title>

      <para>ErraiBus forms the backbone of the Errai framework's approach to
      application design. Most importantly, it provides a straight-forward
      approach to a complex problem space. Providing common APIs across the
      client and server, developers will have no trouble working with complex
      messaging scenarios from building instant messaging clients, stock
      tickers, to monitoring instruments. There's no more messing with RPC
      APIs, or unweildy AJAX or COMET frameworks. We've built it all in to
      one, consice messaging framework. It's single-paradigm, and it's fun to
      work with.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Messaging</title>

      <para>This section will start off with some solid code examples and
      describe the different messaging patterns that are employed by ErraiBus.
      In later sections, we'll delve into the different percularities of the
      API, implications, and more complex cases.</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>The MessageBuilder</title>

        <para>The MessageBuilder is the heart of the messaging API in
        ErraiBus. It provides a fluent / builder API, that is used for
        constructing messages. All three major message patterns can be
        constructed from the MessageBuilder.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Receiving messages on the server side</title>

        <para>Every message has a sender and at least one receiver. A receiver
        is as it sounds--it receives the message and does something with it.
        Implementing a receiver (also referred to as a service) is as simple
        as implementing our standard MessageCallback interface, which is used
        pervasively across, both client and server code. Let's begin with
        server side component that receives messages: <programlisting>
    @Service("HelloWorldService")
    public class HelloWorldService implements MessageCallback {
        public void callback(CommandMessage message) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
                    </programlisting></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Sending messages from a client</title>

        <para>In order to send a message from a client you need to create a
        <emphasis><emphasis><filename>Message</filename></emphasis></emphasis>
        and send it through an instance of <filename>MessageBus</filename>. In
        this simple example we send it to the subject 'HelloWorldService'
        <programlisting>
    public class HelloWorld implements EntryPoint {

        // Get an instance of the MessageBus
        private MessageBus bus = ErraiBus.get();

        public void onModuleLoad() {
            Button button = new Button("Send message");

            button.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() {

            public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
                // Send a message to the 'HelloWorldService'.
                MessageBuilder.createMessage()
                    .toSubject("HelloWorldService")             // (1)
                    .signalling()                               // (2)
                    .noErrorHandling()                          // (3)
                    .sendNowWithBus();                          // (4)
            });

            [...]
         }
    }
                    </programlisting></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Sending messages to a client</title>

        <para>In the following example we extend our server side component to
        reply with a message when the callback method is invoked. It will
        create a message and address it to the subject 'HelloWorldClient':
        <programlisting>
    @Service
    public class HelloWorldService implements MessageCallback {

        private MessageBus bus;

        @Inject
        public HelloWorldService(MessageBus bus) {
            this.bus = bus;
        }

        public void callback(CommandMessage message) {
                // Send a message to the 'HelloWorldClient'.
                MessageBuilder.createMessage()
                    .toSubject("HelloWorldClient")              // (1)
                    .signalling()                               // (2)
                    .with("text", "Hi There")                   // (3)
                    .noErrorHandling()                          // (4)
                    .sendNowWith(bus);                          // (5)
            });
        }
    }
                    </programlisting></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Receiving messages on the client side</title>

        <para>If a client needs to receive messages that are "pushed" from the
        server side it needs to register a listener on a certain subject.
        <programlisting>

    public class HelloWorld implements EntryPoint {
        private MessageBus bus = ErraiBus.get();

        public void onModuleLoad() {
        [...]

        /**
        * Declare a local service to receive messages on the subject
        * "BroadcastReceiver".
        */
        bus.subscribe("BroadcastReceiver", new MessageCallback() {
            public void callback(CommandMessage message) {
                /**
                * When a message arrives, extract the "text" field and
                * do something with it
                */
                String messageText = message.get(String.class, "text");
            }
        });

        [...]
    }
               </programlisting></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Conversations</title>

        <para>Conversations are message exchanges which are between a single
        client and a service. They are a fundmentally important concept in
        ErraiBus, since by default, a message will be broadcast to all client
        services listening on a particular channel.</para>

        <para>When you create a conversation with an incoming message, you
        ensure that the message you are sending back is received by the same
        client which sent the incoming message. A simple example:</para>

        <programlisting>   @Service
    public class HelloWorldService implements MessageCallback {

        private MessageBus bus;

        @Inject
        public HelloWorldService(MessageBus bus) {
            this.bus = bus;
        }

        public void callback(CommandMessage message) {
                // Send a message to the 'HelloWorldClient' on the client that sent us the 
                // the message.
                MessageBuilder.createConversation(message)          
                    .toSubject("HelloWorldClient")              
                    .signalling()                               
                    .with("text", "Hi There! We're having a conversation!")                 
                    .noErrorHandling()                          
                    .sendNowWith(bus);                          
            });
        }
    }</programlisting>

        <para>Note that the only difference between the example in the
        previous section (2.4) and this is the use of the
        <filename>createConversation() </filename>method with
        <filename>MessageBuilder</filename>.</para>

        <para></para>

        <sect3>
          <title>Sender Inferred Subjects</title>

          <para>It is possible for the sender to infer, to whatever
          conversational service it is calling, what subject it would like the
          reply to go to. This is accomplished by utilizing the standard
          <filename>MessageParts.ReplyTo</filename> message part. Using this
          methodology for building conversations is generally
          encouraged.</para>

          <para>Consider the following client side code:</para>

          <programlisting>MessageBuilder.createMessage()
       .toSubject("ObjectService").signalling()
       .with(MessageParts.ReplyTo, "ClientEndpoint")
       .noErrorHandling().sendNowWith(bus);</programlisting>

          <para>And the conversational code on the server (for service
          <emphasis>ObjectService</emphasis>):</para>

          <programlisting>MessageBuilder.createConversation(message)
                .subjectProvided().signalling()
                .with("Records", records)
                .noErrorHandling().sendNowWith(bus);</programlisting>

          <para>In the above examples, assuming that the latter example is
          inside a service called "ObjectService" and is referencing the
          incoming message that was send in the former example, the message
          created will automatically reference the
          <filename>ReplyTo</filename> subject that was provided by the
          sender, and send the message back to the subject desired by the
          client on the client that sent the message.</para>
        </sect3>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Broadcasting</title>

        <para>Broadcasting messages to all clients listening on a specific
        subject is quite simple and involves nothing more than forgoing use of
        the conversation API. For instance:</para>

        <programlisting>MessageBuilder.createMessage().
                 .toSubject("MessageListener")
                 .with("Text", "Hello, from your overlords in the cloud")
                 .noErrorHandling().sendNowWith(bus);</programlisting>

        <para>If sent from the server, all clients currently connected, who
        are listening to the subject <filename>"MessageListener"</filename>
        will receive the message. It's as simple as that.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
        <title>Client-to-Client Communication</title>

        <para>Communication from one client to another client is not directly
        possible within the bus federation, by design. This isn't to say that
        it's not possible. But one client cannot see a service within the
        federation of another client. We institute this limitation as a matter
        of basic security. But many software engineers will likely find the
        prospects of such communication appealing, so this section will
        provide some basic pointers on how to go about accomplishing
        it.</para>

        <sect3>
          <title>Relay Services</title>

          <para>The essential architectural thing you'll need to do is create
          a relay service that runs on the server. Since a service advertised
          on the server is visible to all clients and all clients are visible
          to the server, you might already see where we're going with
          this.</para>

          <para>By creating a service on the server which accepts messages
          from clients, you can create a simple protocol on-top of the bus to
          enable quasi peer-to-peer communication. (We say quasi, because it
          still needs to be routed through the server) </para>

          <para>While you can probably imagine simply creating a
          broadcast-like service which accepts a message from one client and
          broadcasts it to the rest of the world, it may be less clear how to
          go about routing from one particular client to another particualr
          client, so we'll focus on that problem.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">Message Routing
          Information</emphasis></para>

          <para>Every message that is sent between a local and remote (or
          server and client) buses contain session routing information. This
          information is used by the bus to determine what outbound queue's to
          use to deliver the message to their intended recipients. It is
          possible to manually specify this information to indicate to the
          bus, where you want a specific message to go. </para>

          <para>The utility class
          <filename>org.jboss.errai.bus.server.util.ServerBusUtils</filename>
          contains a utility method for extracting the String-based SessionID
          which is used to identify the message queue associated with any
          particular client. You may use this method to extract the SessionID
          from a message so that you may use it for routing. For
          example:</para>

          <programlisting>... 
public void callback(Message message) {
    String sessionId = ServerBusUtils.getSessionId(message);
    
    // Record this sessionId somewhere.
    ...
}
...

</programlisting>

          <para>The SessionID can then be stored in a medium, say a Map, to
          cross-reference specific users or whatever identifier you wish to
          allow one client to obtain a reference to the specific ClientId of
          another client. In which case, you can then provide the SessionID as
          a MessagePart to indicate to the bus where you want the message to
          go.</para>

          <programlisting>MessageBuilder.createMessage()
    .toSubject("ClientMessageListener")
    .signalling()
    .with(MessageParts.SessionID, sessionId)
    .with("Message", "We're relaying a message!")
    .noErrorHandling().sendNowWith(bus);
</programlisting>

          <para>By providing the SessionID part in the message, the bus will
          see this and use it for routing the message to the relevant queue.
          </para>

          <para>Now you're routing from client-to-client!</para>
        </sect3>
      </sect2>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)</title>

      <para>ErraiBus supports a high-level RPC layer to make typical
      client-server RPC communication easy on top of the bus. While it is
      possible to use ErraiBus without ever using this API, you may find it to
      be a more useful and concise approach to exposing services to the
      clients.</para>

      <sect2>
        <title>Creating callable endpoints</title>

        <para>ErraiBus provides facility to making asynchronous RPC calls
        on-top of the bus archhitecture without the need to explicitly declare
        services or any specific mapping or boilerplate code. This method of
        communicating with the server is straight-forward and utilizes the
        simple <filename>RemoteCall</filename> API.</para>

        <para>Remote procedure calls can be be performed against against
        service class which has been annoted with the
        <filename>@Service</filename> annotation and the accompanying method
        which is being called has been annotated with the
        <filename>@Endpoint</filename> annotation, and the method has public
        access.</para>

        <programlisting>@Service
public class QueryService {
   private Map&lt;String, String[]&gt; dataMap;

   public QueryService() {
      setupMap();
   }

   private void setupMap() {
      dataMap = new HashMap&lt;String, String[]&gt;();
      dataMap.put("beer", new String[]{"Heineken", "Budweiser", "Hoogaarden"});
      dataMap.put("fruit", new String[]{"Apples", "Oranges", "Grapes"});
      dataMap.put("animals", new String[]{"Monkeys", "Giraffes", "Lions"});
   }

   @Endpoint
   public String[] getQuery(String queryString) {
      return dataMap.get(queryString.toLowerCase());
   }
}</programlisting>

        <para>Notice the <filename>@Endpoint </filename>annotation on the
        <filename>getQuery()</filename> method in the above figure. In this
        example, the method simply accepts a single String parameter and
        returns an array of Strings. The method can accept and return any
        serializable types that have been exposed to the bus within the rules
        of serializability as laid out in the section on <emphasis>Object
        Serialization</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>Also note that in this example, the service class is not
        required to implement the <filename>MessageCallback</filename>
        interface and is a simple POJO class.</para>

        <para>Calls to RPC endpoints are made using the RemoteCall API which
        is very similar to the MessageBuilder API, with a few key differences.
        Here is some code for calling the RPC endpoint we defined in section
        3.1.</para>

        <programlisting>MessageBuilder.createCall()
           .call("QueryService")                                         // (1)
           .endpoint("getQuery", queryBox.getText())                     // (2)
           .respondTo(String[].class, new RemoteCallback&lt;String[]&gt;() {   // (3)
               public void callback(String[] resultsString) {
                   if (resultsString == null) {
                       resultsString = new String[]{"No results."};
                   }

                   /**
                    * Build an HTML unordered list based on the results.
                    */
                   StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer("&lt;ul&gt;");
                   for (String result : resultsString) {
                       buf.append("&lt;li&gt;").append(result).append("&lt;/li&gt;");
                   }
                   results.setHTML(buf.append("&lt;/ul&gt;").toString());
               }
           })
           .noErrorHandling()
           .sendNowWith(bus);                                           // (4)</programlisting>

        <para>In this example we <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis
        role="bold">(1)</emphasis></emphasis> send a call to the
        <filename>"QueryService"</filename> class with <emphasis
        role="bold">(2)</emphasis> the endpoint
        <filename>"getQuery"</filename>, which is the name of the method which
        we annotated, along with the parameter we which to pass to the method.
        Note that you can send as many parameters as you want as the
        <filename>endpoint()</filename> method accepts varargs
        parameter.</para>

        <para>Then <emphasis role="bold">(3)</emphasis> we declare a
        <filename>RemoteCallback</filename> to handle the response back from
        the server. We declare the response type to be that of
        <filename>String[]</filename> to correlate with the return type of the
        endpoint on the server and fill in handling code for the response. In
        this case we output an HTML unordered list manually.</para>

        <para>Finally <emphasis role="bold">(4)</emphasis> we send the
        call.</para>

      <title>Serialization</title>

      <para>Serialization on the ErraiBus supports serialization within the
      same scope and limitations as the default GWT RPC serialization rules.
      In order to expose your domain objects to the bus so they can be
      exported across the bus, you must annotate them with the
      <filename>org.jboss.errai.bus.server.annotations.ExposeEntity</filename>
      annotation. The presence of this annotation will cause Errai's GWT
      compiler extensions to generate marshall/demarshall stubs for the
      annotated objects at compile-time.</para>

      <para>For example:</para>

      <programlisting>@ExposeEntity
public class Beer {
    public boolean free;
    public String brandName;
    ...
}</programlisting>

      <para>Note: All exposed entities must have a default constructor.</para>

      <title>Wiring server side components</title>

      <para>Currently, ErraiBus uses Google Guice to wire components. However,
      we plan on falling back on the <emphasis>JSR-330 Dependency
      Injection</emphasis> specification in the near future. When deploying
      services on the server-side, it is currently possible to obtain
      references to the <filename>MessageBus</filename>,
      <filename>RequestDispatcher</filename>, the
      <filename>ErraiServiceConfigurator</filename>, and
      <filename>ErraiService</filename> by declaring them as injection

      <title>Using the maven archetype</title>

      <para>If you have taken a look at the examples that ship with the
      distribution, you realized that we use maven to build them. The way it
      is setup, the maven build has several benefits: <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
             It pulls the GWT from a central repository. No need for manual installation of the SDK
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
             It provides us with the proper dependencies in order to run the examples
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
             IDE setup is greatly simplfied, since most modern IDE's can directly import the maven structure
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist> In order to get you going quickly, we've provided a
      project archetype, that allows you to create a project skeleton similiar
      to the one we use for building the examples. It's based on the maven
      archetype plugin <footnote>
           http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-archetype-plugin/
        </footnote> and needs to be invoked from the command line:
      <programlisting>
    mvn archetype:generate
        -DarchetypeGroupId=org.jboss.errai
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=sandbox-archetype
        -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
        -DarchetypeRepository=http://snapshots.jboss.org/maven2
            </programlisting> When invoking the archetype build it ask you
      about the maven groupId, artifactId and package name your GWT
      application should use: <programlisting>
    Define value for groupId: : <emphasis>foo.bar</emphasis>
    Define value for artifactId: : <emphasis>gwt-app</emphasis>
    Define value for version:  1.0-SNAPSHOT: :
    Define value for package:  foo.bar: : <emphasis>foo.bar.ui</emphasis>
    Confirm properties configuration:
    groupId: foo.bar
    artifactId: gwt-app
    version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
    package: foo.bar.ui
    Y: : <emphasis>Y</emphasis>
            </programlisting> What will be created for you, is a maven build
      structure, including references to the GWT SDK and the Errai
      dependencies necessary to launch a simple application: <programlisting>
    Laika:test hbraun$ cd gwt-app/
    Laika:gwt-app hbraun$ lstree
    |-src
    |---main
    |-----java
    |-------foo
    |---------bar
    |-----------client
    |-----------server
    |-war
    |---WEB-INF
            </programlisting> In order launch the GWT hosted mode, change into
      the project directory and type: <programlisting>
    mvn gwt:run
            </programlisting> The default project includes both a HelloWorld
      client (GWT), and a HelloWorld service.</para>
