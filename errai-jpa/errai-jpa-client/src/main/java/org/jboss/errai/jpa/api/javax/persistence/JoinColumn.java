/**
 * Specifies a column for joining an entity association or element
 * collection.  If the <code>JoinColumn</code> annotation itself is
 * defaulted, a single join column is assumed and the default values
 * apply.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Example:
 *
 *   &#064;ManyToOne
 *   &#064;JoinColumn(name="ADDR_ID")
 *   public Address getAddress() { return address; }
 *
 *
 *   Example: unidirectional one-to-many association using a foreign key mapping
 *
 *   // In Customer class
 *   &#064;OneToMany
 *   &#064;JoinColumn(name="CUST_ID") // join column is in table for Order
 *   public Set&#060;Order&#062; getOrders() {return orders;}
